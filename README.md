### About Me ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer and recent law graduate. I discovered my passion for programming while I took a break from law and studied Computer Science for a year. Since then, I have been honing my skills as a web developer and started my own company specialising in delivering solutions to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/) business owners' problems. The solutions often entail working with the Shopify API to develop custom applications or editting the front-end source code that match each client's needs. I am energised by solving complex problems and learning new techonologies and thus, I am currently working towards becoming a full-stack developer.
